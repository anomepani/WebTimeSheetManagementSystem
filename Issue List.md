### I am updating this document to track issue and status

 - [ ] ErrorView/Error Request goes to infinite loops as that route is not available. Same for any 404 error it redirect in infinite loops
 - [ ] Login or redirect after session timeout is not handled correctly, currently it will redirect to Error/Error instead of login page.
 - [ ] Broken /AllExpense/ApprovedExpense page 
 - [ ] packages/bin/obj folder included in git version control which is not required to add in source code.
